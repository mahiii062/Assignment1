                <p class="text">"The interim government's Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus's address to the nation on
                    August 25
                    resonated deeply with the public, striking a chord of authenticity, humility, and aspiration. Social
                    media has been abuzz with comments such as "Dr Yunus's vision for a new Bangladesh gives me hope"
                    and "We needed this kind of leadership years ago." His speech was remarkable not only for what it
                    said, but for how it was delivered—free of arrogance, malice or personal gratification. Instead, it
                    was a call to action, focusing on the urgent need for national unity and the commitment to building
                    a new, democratic, and inclusive Bangladesh."</p>
